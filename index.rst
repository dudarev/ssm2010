About SSM2010
--------------

The Third Annual Workshop on Search in Social Media (`SSM 2010 <http://ir.mathcs.emory.edu/SSM2010/>`__) took place in New York on February 3rd 2010. It came to my attention because of tweets by Hilary Mason (`@hmason <http://twitter.com/hmason>`__). The topics discussed are of great interest to me nowadays. Informal proceedings by all the speakers are `available in PDF format <http://ir.mathcs.emory.edu/SSM2010/proceedings.html>`__.

Notes
------

Thanks to the tweets from the audience (especially Gene Golovchinsky `@ HCIR_GeneG <http://twitter.com/HCIR_GeneG>`__) it was possible to follow discussions during the panels. Ian Soboroff `@ian_soboroff <http://twitter.com/ian_soboroff>`__ initiated archiving of tweets hashtaged with #ssm2010 at http://twapperkeeper.com/ssm2010/

It was fun to follow the discussions during the meeting with Twitter search. To somewhat systematize thoughts I used `mind mapping <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map>`__ approach with `FreeMind <http://freemind.sourceforge.net/>`__ software. Below are the files for the first and the second panels exported to HTML and in native FreeMind format:
    - First panel (Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google representatives) [`html <ssm2010_first_panel.html>`__, `mm <ssm2010_first_panel.mm>`__]
    - Second panel (representatives from Myspace, Bit.ly, LinkedIn) [`html <ssm2010_second_panel.html>`__, `mm <ssm2010_second_panel.mm>`__]
